# Written Pin Yin (关于书面中文拼音)
Some thoughts on making written Chinese PinYin easier to understand.

A few years back after my visit to Wuhan China, I saw the fast development / progress in infrastructure, to most of which I felt great and amazing.

On the other hand, as a native mandarin speaker who had lived in the west for over 10 years, and as a hobbist coder, I thought about some improvement that might be useful for both foreigners visiting China, but also for Chinese people. So I wrote 2 blogs on qzone.com as linked below.



I do know that I am not an expert in Chinese language, and I don't have direct connection to any Chinese linguist. So even though I came up with those ideas, I have not actually done anything to move it further.

Now with the reach of github, I am hoping that I could at least get the idea out to the public.
